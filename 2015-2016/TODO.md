- Try giving it ball position as an input
- Make it so we can pick up a genome and train from there, rather than starting over every time
- Train against simpler AIs to start, and then go harder and harder (perhaps keep track of global state by writing to a file)

Would be cool:
- To throw this on a server and have people be able to play against it, and train it in the process
  - Maybe using this: http://www.skulpt.org/
